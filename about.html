    <h2>Reasons for joining Altschool</h2>
    <p>I joined Altschool because of 
        the tremendous curiosity and 
        interest I have for Software engineering.
        I truly enjoy coding, and think it is fun,
        and a very good skill to acquire because it 
        is a Job in demand in the market now.
        I would like to build my own frontend Software,
        and one of the ways to allow me to achieve is through
        joining Alt school.
